// Command is the concrete command type KVService submits to the Raft log to
// manage its state machine. It's also used to carry the results of the command
// after it's applied to the state machine. These are the supported commands:
//
// CommandGet: queries a key's value
//
// * Key is the key to get, Value is ignored
// * CompareValue is ignored
// * ResultFound is true iff Key was found in the store
// * ResultValue is the value, if Key was found in the store
//
// CommandPut: assigns value to the key
//
// * Key,Value are the pair to assign (store[key]=value)
// * CompareValue is ignored
// * ResultFound is true iff Key was previously found in the store
// * ResultValue is the old value of Key, if it was previously found
//
// CommandAppend: appends to a key's value
//
//	If Key wasn't previously in the store, it's created with the given
//	Value (as if it was present with an empty value before this operation).
//
// * Performs Store[Key] = Store[Key] + Value, where "+" is a string append
// * CompareValue is ignored
// * ResultFound is true iff the Key was found in the store
// * ResultValue is the old value of Key, before the append
//
// CommandCAS: atomic compare-and-swap, performs:
//
//	if Store[Key] == CompareValue {
//	  Store[Key] = Value
//	} else {
//	  nop
//	}
//
// * Key is the key this command acts on
// * CompareValue is the previous value the command compares to
// * Value is the new value the command assigns
// * ResultFound is true iff Key was previously found in the store
// * ResultValue is the old value of Key, if it was previously found
